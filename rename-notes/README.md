## Rename Notes ##

**Work in progress.**

A combination of scripts and Hazel rules that checks my Dropbox notes folder for note titles that don't match my tagging convention and list them out in a new note. Editing the text in that note with rename the corresponding note making it easy to review any new notes that were dumped in using nvALT and need to be cleaned up for posterity's sake.
